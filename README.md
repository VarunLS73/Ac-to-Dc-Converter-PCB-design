# Ac-to-Dc-Converter-PCB-design
An AC to DC converter is an essential circuit used in various electronic
applications to convert high-voltage alternating current (AC) into lowvoltage
direct current (DC). This project focuses on designing and implementing
an AC to DC converter that steps down 220V AC mains supply to
a stable 5V DC output.
